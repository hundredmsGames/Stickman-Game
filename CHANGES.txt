-check if the camera shakes when you use velocity instead of addForce
-if it does shake then search it ...
-Improve UI design.
-Make your own line renderer.
-add water to bottom so we can know how did ball died(perlin noise)
-add info to failed screen so we can know how did ball died
-breakable platforms like glass  
-RestartButton
